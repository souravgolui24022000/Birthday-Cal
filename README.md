# Birthday-Cal

Birthday Cal is a week long Calendar. It's a fun  way to demonstrate Vanilla JS skills.


How does it work
Just drop a json data in the text area in the below given format and hit the update button to see the magic!

Render a card for each day of the week. For a given year, figure out whose birthday belongs to which card. Place people's initials in the card according to the these rules.

Each person must always be rendered as a square.
Use person's initials to label birthdays.
Order people inside the card based on their age(youngest to oldest)
Each square in a card must be of equal size and should fill up as much space in the card as possible.
